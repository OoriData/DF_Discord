    '''
    Generate a Discord timestamp string for a given datetime or ISO format string and format letter.

    Args:
        formatted_time (str | datetime): The datetime object or ISO format string to format. 
                                         If a string is provided, it should be in ISO 8601 format.
                                         The datetime object **must** have a timezone set!

        format_letter (str): The format letter specifying the Discord timestamp style. Possible values are:
        - 'd': Short date (e.g., 01/31/2024)
        - 'f': Long date with time (e.g., January 31, 2024 01:45 PM)
        - 't': Short time (e.g., 01:45 PM)
        - 'D': Long date (e.g., January 31, 2024)
        - 'F': Day of the week, long date with time (e.g., Wednesday, January 31, 2024 01:45 PM)
        - 'R': Relative time (e.g., <Time remaining since/until>)
        - 'T': Long time with seconds (e.g., 01:45:30 PM)

    Returns:
        str: The Discord-formatted timestamp string.

## Welcome to the **Desolate Frontiers**!

This thing's still in Alpha, so things *will* break and that the game *is not* finished! If you have an issue, please DM Choccy (or just holler in #general)!

- You'll be managing a logistics company, running convoys of land vehicles across the remains of the US, carrying all manner of useful goods. 🚛
- To get started, run **`/desolate-frontiers`** to get your account signed up for our system. You'll also get to name your first convoy there! 💻
  - **Be patient with these buttons, please! Don't button mash!** we're working on speeding up their responsiveness, but we totally understand that it's a bit frustrating that it takes up to 5 seconds to get feedback from pressing them sometimes.
  - Also, **your interaction will time out sometimes!** This is a bit of a technical limitaiton on the discord side of things; we're working on figuring out a more clever solution for this ASAP; it annoys us even more than it annoys you, and it'll annoy you a whole lot!
    - in the meantime, if your interaction times out, you can just call **`/desolate-frontiers`** again!
- Next, you'll need to buy a vehicle. 🚗
  - Use the gray button with a city name to investigate the vendors in the city you spawned in, and head to the ~~dealership~~ stealership to get yourself some wheels.
  - The menus there are a little janky. We're cookin' on 'em!
- After that, you're gonna need to buy some **Fuel** from the gas station, which you can also access from the `city name` button. ⛽️
  - **Your vehicle has a gas tank!** While you can buy more jerry cans if you wanna cary more fuel, you can just buy fuel straight from the blue `buy fuel` button to fill up your tank.
    - Your vehicle doesn't have capacity for water or food, though. That's handled in the next bullet!
  - Next, grab some water from the market; (imaginatively named) **Water Jerry Cans**
  - Finally, you'll wanna buy some **MRE boxes** to feed your crew, also at the market.
  - Note that these jerry cans and MREs you buy are already full! No need to refill them before you move on to the next step.
- With the basics down, it's time for your first delivery. 📦
  - Head to the market once again and look into the goods with a **Profit margin**, which will earn you some money once you bring them to their destination.
- Now that you have a vehicle, prepared resources, and a delivery to fulfill, you're ready to get on the road! 🛣️
  - Use the gray `convoy` button, hit `Embark on new Journey` **wait a really long time for that menu to load** (we're working on that lag, sorry!), and select the destination of the cargo you just bought.
  - Your convoy will present you the path it will take to get there and how many resources you'll use in the process; hit `Embark upon Journey` to send them on their way!
    - If you picked a really far delivery, you might not be able to make it. You can either make the journey in two parts by going halfway, then later going the rest of the way, or you can go back to the market and buy some more resources.
- ...and now you wait! Desolate Frontiers is an idle game; you'll get a ping when your convoy arrives. 📱
  - If you're curious about its progress, you can use **`/desolate-frontiers`** to check up on it.

Happy trails! The game will be updated frequently, and we will be listening closely for any feedback you've got. Have fun!
-# You can show this message at any time with **`/df-help`**
